# Project Deity

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Frostflake/project-deity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Frostflake/project-deity)

### Introduction
Welcome to a world where you are not a character. You cannot control anything in this world, but you are worshipped by an individual. As their deity of sorts, it is your responsibility to guide them along their journey -- whether they decide to listen to you or not, or how they interpret your messages, is entirely up to them.

Your follower is one you've picked from among the general population, but they're not the only one. Hundreds of other deities have also chosen champions, and their beliefs may not always line up with your goals. As your devotee lives their life in real time, you only have enough strength to push them in the direction you wish. Will your champion live a long life of success, or die in a dungeon somewhere, forgotten entirely?

### Wait, what?
The gameplay revolves around occasional "divine messages" from you, as well as a very in-depth item system. Each item is unique in some way depending on who crafted it, where it was crafted, and what was used to make it. Even a simple iron sword can have hundreds of possible additives to the crafting process, allowing for fun character builds and interesting scenarios.

### This sounds too complicated...
As a deity, your follower(s) believe that any excess materials or items they obtain are worthy of tribute. You have direct access to their inventories and can use things as you see fit, but your follower will also craft, use, buy, sell and loot items. Taking away their potions may result in their death, and a gift you bestow may end up rusting away in a pawn shop. On the other hand, you may find it better to take away explosives before your champion uses it for a party trick, and a divine blade might be just what your devotee needs to slaughter every single skeleton in the dungeon.

### How do the other dieties come into play?
After the last spiritual war brought humanity close to extinction, all of the dieties agreed to sign a non-aggression pact. At least, directly.
While some dieties may be happy to help along your champion or exchange items with you, others may disagree with your values and use their champions as assassins of sorts... assuming their followers listen to them.

### How do I play or use this?
At the moment, this is more of a template for an engine than anything. Please hold tight.
